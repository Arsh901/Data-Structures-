Recursion -> a way of solving a problem by having a function call itself

Methodology -
-> Perform same operation multiple times with different input
-> In every step, we try smaller inputs to make problem smaller
-> Base condition needed to stop recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur

Recursion can be used when a given problem can be divided into several sub-problems
and each sub-problem is similar to the entire problem

Recursion is not time or space efficient compared to iterative method. But recursion is easy to implement.
Recursion must be avoided when time and space complexity matter. It uses embedded memory in the
form of stack and it can be slow to use.
