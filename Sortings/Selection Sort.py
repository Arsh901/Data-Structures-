# Selection Sort
"""We repeatedly find the minimum element and move it to sorted part of array to make unsorted part sorted"""

"""
When to use this sorting -
  --> When size of the list is small. 
  --> No extra space is needed
When to avoid - 
  --> The size of list is very large. Finding min element again and again is difficult
